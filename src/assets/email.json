The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.\n\nAs you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.\n\nThanks,\n\nRenee\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tAllen, Phillip K.  \nSent:\tThursday, November 01, 2001 8:26 AM\nTo:\tRatcliff, Renee\nSubject:\t\n\nRenee,\n\nThank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don\u0027t understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads \"The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.\"  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.\n\nThank you,\n\nPhillip Allen",

We should be able to work with this.\n\nPhillip\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tmery.l.brown@accenture.com@ENRON  \nSent:\tMonday, November 05, 2001 5:11 PM\nTo:\tpallen@enron.com\nCc:\tdonald.l.barnhart@accenture.com; kmcdani@enron.com\nSubject:\tInterface Design Update\n\nPhillip,\n\nThe purpose of this e-mail is to explain the results of our discussions\nwith the technical team after our meeting with you. We need to get your\napproval of the points listed below so that we can begin building the\napplication.\n\nWe can have the Position and P\u0026L Reports show the results of the learner\u0027s\ndecisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward in\ntime with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners\n\"more rope\" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order to\nachieve this, we will have the following constraints:\n   The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday\u0027s\n   meeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P\u0026L and\n   positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous\n   period. We will not, for example, be able to say things like \"In\n   November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw\n   gas. What you should have done was...\"\n   We cannot save the P\u0026L and position numbers. This means that if the\n   learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences\n   a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to\n   start over at time period one.\n   We cannot have the learner calculate P\u0026L on storage costs,\n   transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the right\n   answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the\n   decisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down any\n   path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and\n   the right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actually\n   better if we don\u0027t have the learner calculate P\u0026L because he has already\n   calculated P\u0026L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and\n   conversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback we\n   would have to give about specific P\u0026L numbers will not flow well with\n   the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this\n   task.\n\nWe cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq framework\ndoes not support the downloading of data into external applications. The\ntechnical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our current\ndevelopment budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learner\non the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make the\nmistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices.\n\nIf you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of day\nWednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of this\nsimulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please let\nme know if you would like to set up a meeting.\n\nThank you.\nMery\n\n\nThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\nprivileged or confidential information.

    "body": "John,\n\nManaging VAR limits is essential and P\u0026L Penalties are a great way to achieve this.  However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.\n\nI still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG\u0026E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.  \n\nI realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (\u003c$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.\n\nPlease consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.\n\n\nPhillip\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n",

The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.\n\nAs you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.

Therefore, once the inspection/repairs are completed by El Paso, the company will seek permission from OPS to resume to full service. OPS would probably grant them approval within a matter of days.

    "body": "Greg,\r\n\r\nI noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.  First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, part of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for \"seniors\".  I would like to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assisted living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I have mentioned,  my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over the next two years.  At the current rate that amount would cover the equity requirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest partner like Keith.\r\n\r\nHere is the article:\r\n\r\nSector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  Home and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised future land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San Marcos City Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 square mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable and appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affecting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corner of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  Weatherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of various city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner says were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford\u0027s 54 acre tract -- which have no direct effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density residential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven additional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight acres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is suggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of commercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to \"community commercial\" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ensure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete with buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed to separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan.  However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew some concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may pose on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing the proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Avenue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughson supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sector Plan, but evaluating a developer\u0027s plans for possibly locating one in the area as development proceeds.  \"I\u0027d rather say \"no\u0027 and if someone comes us with a really good idea, look at it then,\" Hughson said.  Councilman Ed Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of the curb cut.  \"It seems to me we\u0027re asking for a bunch of accidents to happen there,\" Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclude curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from several residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active critic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concerning the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests of the city as a whole.  \"This is not a victory for one side or the other,\" said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to Weatherford\u0027s initial plans for his property, \"but a victory for the City of San Marcos. We started out with all R-1...we\u0027ve come a long way.\" \t\r\n \r\n",

The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso\u0027s non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions.\n\nThe expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso\u0027s Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso\u0027s existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.\n\nThe receipt points on El Paso\u0027s system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG\u0026E\u0027s proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso\u0027s bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso\u0027s south mainline system where capacity exists.\n\n``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,\u0027\u0027 said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.\n\nInterested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.\n\nEl Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

    "body": "\r\nPam please review.  I don\u0027t want to misrepresent your position to Greg.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreg,\r\n\r\nAfter making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  \r\n\r\nSection 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant\u0027s deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.\r\n\r\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distribution of all of the Participant\u0027s deferral accounts\" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.\r\n\r\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6.3\t\tPlan Administrators\t\tSection 7.1\r\n\r\nNumber of shares\t\t6,600\tshares\t\t6,600\tshares\t\t\t6,600 shares\r\nRelative share price\t\t$27.23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$83.13\r\nPhantom Stock Value\t\t$179,718\t\t\t\t\t\t$548,658\r\n10% Penalty\t\t\t-17,972\t\t\t -600\t\t\t\t-54,866\r\nValue to be distributed\t\t$161,746\t\t6,000 shares\t\t\t$493,792\r\nCurrent stock price\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$10\r\nDistribution\t\t\t$161,746\t\t6,000 shares\t\t\t49,379 shares\r\n\r\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   \r\n\r\nIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nPhillip Allen    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It was built by a developer who is a friend\nof ours and has been constructing POs for many years.

We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.\n  \t\tSoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. \n\nHedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.\n\nInfrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG\u0026E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.\n\n(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).",

Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies \"to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports.\" Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp.

I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  \n\nI expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:\n\nSales price:\t\t2,100,000\nPurchase price\t\t1,200,000\nFees\u0026Devel costs\t  500,000\n\nProfit\t\t\t 400,000\n\nThe cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.\n\nI am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.\n\nI am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. \n\n First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?\n\nSecond,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.\n\nIf neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?\n\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nPhillip Allen\t\n8855 Merlin Ct\nHouston, TX 77055\npallen70@hotmail.com\nwk 713-853-7041\nhm 713-463-8626",

    "body": "\r\n\r\n\r\nGreg,\r\n\r\nAfter making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  \r\n\r\nSection 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant\u0027s deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.\r\n\r\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distribution of all of the Participant\u0027s deferral accounts\" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.\r\n\r\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6.3\t\tPlan Administrators\t\tSection 7.1\r\n\r\nNumber of shares\t\t6,600\tshares\t\t6,600\tshares\t\t\t6,600 shares\r\nRelative share price\t\t$27.23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$83.13\r\nPhantom Stock Value\t\t$179,718\t\t\t\t\t\t$548,658\r\n10% Penalty\t\t\t-17,972\t\t\t -600\t\t\t\t-54,866\r\nValue to be distributed\t\t$161,746\t\t6,000 shares\t\t\t$493,792\r\nCurrent stock price\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$10\r\nDistribution\t\t\t$161,746\t\t6,000 shares\t\t\t49,379 shares\r\n\r\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   \r\n\r\nIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nPhillip Allen    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Meanwhile, I wanted to pass on some news...the Killeen post office probably is gone...I wrote a contract this morning that\u0027s now on its way to California for signature. Of course, if you wanted to submit one also, we can do it fairly quickly.\n\nIncidentally, I had the price wrong on Killeen...it\u0027s $1,377,550, not $1,360,000.\n\nHOWEVER!! Here\u0027s info about another new listing that may be ideal for you; it\u0027s a brand new post office at CANYON LAKE, just north of SA, and in a really ideal location to serve all the small communities that surround the reservoir. I have attached a flyer for you...this one, like Killeen, will not be around long because there are other brokers promoting it. I have talked to the postmaster, who tells me that almost all the boxes are gone, and the building is just now ready for occupancy. CPS is connecting over 2200 new power boxes a month in the area. It\u0027s really growing. Let me know what you think!!\n\nWith best regards, Jim Wills\n\nPhillip.K.Allen@enron.com wrote:\n\n\u003e Jim,\n\u003e\n\u003e I received your email on the Killeen post office.

Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.\nHertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address \"the DWR contract problem\" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.\nChristian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any \"out clauses\" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that \"outs\" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)\nIn addition, we\u0027ve started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.\nAll this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone\u0027s contract rights.\n\nWe\u0027d like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We\u0027d like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn\u0027t, please let me know if there\u0027s a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.\n\nThanks,\nJeff",

(2)\nRoles associated within the Desk - \u003c\u003cAccording to Berney Aucoin \u003e\u003e Admin\nsupport and Commerical support should not be added.  We are concentrating\non the major roles within a desk, any more granular could be inaccurate\nbecause it is different for every company.

(2) Industrial, Retail and\nWholesale was added as an i.e., by consumption by consumer\n\nOrganizational Structure - (1) Communication - Inter/Intra department\ncommunications were added into the Challenges of Managing Trading Function\nand Trading System. Inter department communication (i.e., between\ndepartments within organization) and Intra department communications (i.e.,\nbetween roles on a desk after a trade/deal) (between desks, internal\ncommunication between Marketer, Originator, Structurer and Trader, after a\ntrade and reconciling position reports)\n\nRisk Management Inputs - Consequences within VaR guidelines was added to\n\"Trading outside of prescribed VaR guidelines\n\nSwaps - Types of credit classifications was added to Credit Review under\nProtecting Againist Loss.\n\nThe note for the references used was included on every topic framework -\n*Note: Please note in your assignments when using additional resources\nother than the BRM course material and your own knowledge.

Of visiting deer she writes, \"I love watching the deer, which  always arrive like magic or a miracle or the answer to an unasked  question.\" In her popular book  A  Natural History of the Senses , Ackerman celebrates  the human body; in Cultivating Delight: A Natural History of  My Garden, she turns her attention to the world outside the body,  outside the human sphere.

There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been\ndiscussing. These changes result in:\n        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos\n        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)\n        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and\n        talent) that we have casted for.\n\nLaura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.\nWe have recieved today (mid-day).\n\nBased on our last discussion, I\u0027d like to recommend we set the date for our\nshoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.\nThis recommendation is based on the response I received from our project\nmanager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our\nscripts.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.

    "body": "For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a \"single sum distribution,\" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  \n\nSection 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.\n\nAdditionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  \n\n      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.\n",

    "body": "To all of our esteemed \u0026 prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:\n\nYou probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls\n(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November \u0026 December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\n\nName\nAddress\nCity, State Zip+4\nPhone #\nE-Mail Address\n\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\n\nAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)\nordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHoward Gordon\nNetwork Manager\n\n - geninfo.vcf ",

Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.\n\nI would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.\n\nCommunication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.\n\nIf you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.\n\nHappy New Year\n\nLouise",

    "body": "Phillip,\n\nThis section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.\n\nAs you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.

Amount of Benefit Payments reads \"The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.\"  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.\n\nThank you,\n\nPhillip Allen",

    "body": "Michelle\nHere are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME\u0027s today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).\n\nSheri\n\nWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a \"Dateline\" type theme for one, and a \"60 Minute\" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)? \n\n\n \n\nCheers Kirk\n---------------------- Forwarded by Kirk McDaniel/HOU/EES on 11/27/2001 09:31 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nKirk McDaniel\n11/27/2001 01:41 AM\nTo:\tMichelle Cash/Enron@EnronXGate\ncc:\tTim O\u0027Rourke/Enron@EnronXGate, Yevgeny Frolov/Enron@EnronXGate, mery.l.brown@accenture.com, laura.a.de.la.torre@accenture.com, donald.l.barnhart@accenture.com \nSubject:\tRM Simulation Storyline Scripts - Ready for Legal Review\n\nMichelle\n\nThanks for your support of the BRM project.

Your comments were incorporated in\nthe scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company as\nboth Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so that\nthere is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coach\nexit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.

    "body": "Wow!  this looks complicated.  let me get some help on this and get back to you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: \tAllen, Phillip K.  \r\nSent:\tFriday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AM\r\nTo:\tWhalley, Greg; Lavorato, John\r\nSubject:\tFW: \r\n\r\n\r\nGreg,\r\n\r\nAfter making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  \r\n\r\nSection 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant\u0027s deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.\r\n\r\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distribution of all of the Participant\u0027s deferral accounts\" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.\r\n\r\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6.3\t\tPlan Administrators\t\tSection 7.1\r\n\r\nNumber of shares\t\t6,600\tshares\t\t6,600\tshares\t\t\t6,600 shares\r\nRelative share price\t\t$27.23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$83.13\r\nPhantom Stock Value\t\t$179,718\t\t\t\t\t\t$548,658\r\n10% Penalty\t\t\t-17,972\t\t\t -600\t\t\t\t-54,866\r\nValue to be distributed\t\t$161,746\t\t6,000 shares\t\t\t$493,792\r\nCurrent stock price\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$10\r\nDistribution\t\t\t$161,746\t\t6,000 shares\t\t\t49,379 shares\r\n\r\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   \r\n\r\nIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nPhillip Allen    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

    "body": "To our IBS Customers that are still hanging in there:\n\nWe understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest\napologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to\nyour questions. The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3)\npossibilities:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message that you have\nexceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message \"You\nhave failed to correctly login three times today; please try again\ntomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password\nreset.\" This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one\nquickly with you online (on the phone). Should you receive this message,\nplease call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard\nGordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @\n830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please\nleave your Name, Account # and call back #.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder.\n\n3)  If you see this error message \"Invalid login; please try again\"\n(after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last\ncategory. Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly\n(we will not release any information about these accounts until we\nverify that all information is correct and accurate). We are finalizing\nthese accounts today and should have them available for access this\nafternoon (late) or this evening. Once we release these accounts for IBS\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\n\nName\nAddress\nCity, State Zip+4\nPhone #\nE-Mail Address\n\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\n\nShould you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and\ntransactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night). We\nwill have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then\ninformation will be as of Monday (11/19/01). Again we want to thank you\nfor your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to\ncontinuing to service your IBS needs in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHoward Gordon\nNetwork Manager\n\n - geninfo.vcf ",

We will\nmeet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we\u0027ve\ndesigned them so far and arrive at a solution.

I understand you will be\nobtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories.  Thank you\nfor your help.  Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind:\n\nNumber of SMEs needed:  10\nNumber of expert stories: 20-25\nCharacteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a\nmix of structurers, originators and traders\n\n\nI\u0027ve included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will\nfollow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The main\ndifference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of\n11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with\nthem for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at\nleast 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.\n\n(11/26-11/28)\n                         --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs\n(11/28-11/30)\n                         --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding\nthe simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to\ndiscuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.\n(12/3-12/6)\n               --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we\nneed and where they can provide stories.\n                          --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the\nstories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video\nshoot.\n                          --Make changes to stories, if necessary.\n                          --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to\nSMEs\n(12/10-12/12)\n                          --Video shoot\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks,\nAnn\n\n\n\nThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\nprivileged, proprietary, or otherwise private information.

    "body": "Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.\n\nI have added another post office for your consideration. It\u0027s in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.\n\nIn any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you\u0027ve already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you. With best regards, Jim Wills\n\nPhillip.K.Allen@enron.com wrote:\n\n\u003e Jim,\n\u003e\n\u003e Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.  Your\n\u003e insurance and repair numbers seem very low.   Also, assuming that the\n\u003e options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of\n\u003e faith.  I don\u0027t believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf\n\u003e that they are being offered at.\n\u003e\n\u003e Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable\n\u003e purchasing a post office at this time.

You\nsay that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I\njust did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost\nwas about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we\ncan discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90\nper sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the\ntrue custom home level but should be achievable with good management.\nRichard Morgan\nManager, Green Building Program\nAustin Energy\n721 Barton Springs Rd.\nAustin, TX 78704-1194\nPh. 512.505.3709\nFax 512.505.3711\ne-mail richard.morgan@austinenergy.com\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Allen, Phillip K. [mailto:Phillip.K.Allen@ENRON.com]\nSent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:19 AM\nTo: Morgan, Richard\nSubject:\n\n\nRichard,\n\nI spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with\nSIP\u0027s.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can\ndecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints\ncompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP\u0027s with\n8.5\" roof panels and use a metal roof.\n\nI have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that\nis also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of\n$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within\nthat budget.  I don\u0027t want to settle for a conventional stick built\nhouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a\nradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same\nenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP\u0027s. For example, I just spoke to\na sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.\nThat would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional\ncosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?\nDo you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help\nme construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from\nWink with Premier based on you reference.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nPhillip Allen\npallen@enron.com\n713-853-7041\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and\nmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the\nintended recipient (s).
